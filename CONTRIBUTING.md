## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a Ribose open source project!
If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull
request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to
change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a
wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy
(you are here), our LICENSE, and our README, all of which should be in this
repository. If you have any questions, or want to read more about our
underlying policies, you can consult the Metanorma Open Source Policy or contact
us at [open.source@ribose.com](mailto:open.source@ribose.com).

## Contributing to the scripts

Edit the `mac` file.
If you added or removed any tools, document your changes in the `README.md`
file.
Follow shell style guidelines by using [ShellCheck].

```sh
# Install shellcheck
brew install shellcheck

# Run shellcheck from the root of the repo
shellcheck mac
```

All contributions to this project will become part of this open source project.
